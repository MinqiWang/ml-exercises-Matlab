A single DT is not very prone to over-fitting with the occupancy dataset. 
Roughly, the classification accuracy increases when the nubmer of trees 
increases. 

Generally, a random forest is helpful because we get a more stable accuracy
with more trees and we are less affected by the noise in the training data.
A single DT might overfit the training data in some situations, which 
depends on what portion of data and features are decided to be considered. 
However,it's very unlikely that all of the trees overfit the training data 
when we have more than one randomly configured tree, which is why a random 
forest is helpful.

However, for this particular dataset, the forest is not so helpful as a
single tree can do very good prediction on the validation set and test set,
because there are relatively few features and large training data set.
